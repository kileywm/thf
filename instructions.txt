INSTRUCTIONS
[0] Be sure MacroQuest is not running.

[1] Copy over macro files to the Macros folder.
  actions.inc
  EDITMEgroups.inc
  clickies.inc
  class.mac
  Spell_routines.inc
  
[1.5] Copy over MacroQuest.ini to your main MQ2 folder.
  MacroQuest.ini

[2] Copy over class macros to the Macros folder.
  class.mac
  Nbards.mac
  Nberserkers.mac
  etc...
  
    Your files should now look like...
  |-[MQ2_Emu]
  |-  MacroQuest.ini
  |-  [Macros]
  |-    actions.inc
  |-    clickies.inc
  |-    Spell_routines.inc
  |-    class.mac
  |-    groups.inc
  |-    Nbards.mac
        etc...

[3] Modify EDITMEgroups.inc to contain your characters' names and the appropriate number of players you will be boxing.
  [3.1] Change GroupLead[x] to where x is the number of groups you have.
    Example:
      For 3 groups...
      /if (!${Defined[GroupLead]})      /declare GroupLead[3] string outer UNDEFINED-ARRAY-ELEMENT
  [3.2] If you have 3 groups, then there should be 3 group leaders. Modify the GroupLead array elements to contain group leader names. Create or delete the necessary lines.
    Example:
      For 3 groups...
      /varset GroupLead[1] Mand
      /varset GroupLead[2] Tweety
      /varset GroupLead[3] Barnyard
      
      For 1 group...
      /varset GroupLead[1] Mand
  [3.3] Rename EDITMEgroups.inc to just groups.inc when you are done editing it. If you do not, the macros will not be able to find it.

[4] Start EQBCServer.exe

[5] Start MacroQuest2.exe

[6] Once all characters are logged in issue the following command to start their macros:
  /macros

  Alternatively, if you want to initiate the macro on just one character, then you need only type /mac class.

[7] To see all available commands, simply type /commands while the macro is running.

[8] The first command you may want to do is /stickme. This will assemble all of your players together, sticking to the player who issued the command.

  The / commands were designed where most follow a consistent format. A / command will be obeyed by the character issuing it. To broadcast it to all players on your team, simply add a 'b' (for broadcast) at the front of it.
  /hold will cause you to hold all actions.
  /bhold will broadcast to all players to hold all actions.

[9] When not in a raid... to initiate combat on ONLY ONE character (applies to all, even healers), simply target the mob (even healers target the mob) and type /solo.

[10] Also notice that there are some handy alternative macros like godlypoints.mac that I was too lazy to implement into the full macro.
